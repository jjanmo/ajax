            The World Wide Web (WWW), commonly known as the Web, is an information system where
            documents and other web resources are identified by Uniform Resource Locators (URLs,
            such as https://www.example.com/), which may be interlinked by hypertext, and are
            accessible over the Internet. The resources of the WWW are transfered via the Hypertext
            Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and may be accessed by users by a software application called a
            web browser and are published by a software application called a web server.
